# DigiTrainer
Among the biggest challenges strength trainers, expecially those new to strength and resistance training, is knowing how to conduct unfamiliar exercises and their strength level in these unfamiliar exercises. In collaboration with the S3D Department at Carnegie Mellon University, I propose DigiTrainer.

DigiTrainer is a Computer Vision and Machine Learning-based system that aims to assist individuals by classifying exercise form as correct or incorrect using varying length time series classification, provide feedback to users if form is incorrect, and predict what weight an individual can lift for x amount of repetitions so that by the end of that repetition range they reach or are about to reach failure.

# Current Advancements
By analyzing 4 key joint angles, DigiTrainer is able to classify good and bad dumbell bicep curl form through two main classification mechanisms (kNN classifier with DTW principles; Shapelet classification). Stay tuned for upcoming system updates.
